# Day 1 (2025-08-25)

## Flow of control you encountered

* try/except

## Exceptions you encountered

* `TypeError`

## Data structures you encountered

* Tuples - Just like a `list` but you cannot change it. `a = (3, 4, 5)`. Access elements with `[]`, e.g., `print(a[1])`.

## Syntax you encountered

Nothing new (yet)

## Keywords you encountered

* `False` - Boolean (see also `False`).
* `is` - Can be used to check if a variable refers to some exact object (e.g., `if a is None`).

## Built-in functions you encountered

* `all` - Returns True if all elements are true (`all(x for x in some_list)`).
* `any` - Returns True if any element is true (`any(x == 4 for x in (4, 5, 6))`).
* `sum` - Add things up (`total = sum(4, 5, 6)`).

## String functions you encountered

Nothing new (yet).
