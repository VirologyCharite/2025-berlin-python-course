# Berlin Python Course 2025

When non-programmers working with data run into a problem they cannot solve
with pre-existing tools (e.g., Excel), the reaction is usually either to
ask someone else for help, to do it manually, or to give up.

In this course we will add another option: write a program. The course aim is
concrete and modest: turn you into someone who, when faced with a data problem,
thinks "I can write a quick script to solve that problem" (and then does
so). Many people go back to their regular lives after taking courses, don’t put
into practice what they learned, and eventually forget it all. I don’t want that
to happen with our course. We'll aim to turn everyone into an active programmer.
To get you going on a path that fundamentally changes how you work with data for
the rest of your career. It’s impossible to learn everything about programming
in a week, but it is possible to take the crucial first steps and to make them
stick.

## Why I teach this course

This course takes 2% of my year.

I put in a constant effort, and you get a super power forever.

It's like having a super power because programming gives you a tool that you can
use to make other tools.

Information processing is fundamental. Evolution shapes us to efficiently
process information. Now we've reached the point where a species can build
machines that simulate other machines and write programs to run on them to
process information however we like. It's quite extraordinary.  Working
with information is somehow so fundamental.  It's like math, only even more
general.

Being able to write code is really a general skill that is likely to be of
use to you no matter what your occupation is.

But, you _have to_ have the right attitude!

And, you have to believe what I tell you. I have 45+ years of programming
experience and you have zero :-)

You are in fact already very close to being programmers, you just don't know it.

## General comments on learning to program

_Everyone_ was once a complete beginner.

It's actually *really great* to know nothing and to have no background.
There is no stronger position. No one assumes things about you, there are
no dumb questions, you don't have to pretend, you can learn without
acquiring bad habits.

We're all piecemeal in our knowledge because this is not our job. That's
ok. It means within a short amount of time of starting you will know
things that (more experienced) others will not, and that, in reverse,
people who overall know much less than you will know more about some
aspects than you do. Don't be arrogant, help one another.

I only know things piecemeal because I never really made computers my job.
You'll always be piecemeal too. It means you'll always have holes, people will
always know more than you do. It means you'll complement others and vice
versa. Be humble, be useful.

I make mistakes all the time!

I have to look things up all the time!

## Course aims

Get you "over the hump" and turn you into a programmer (or a better
programmer).

Get rid of fear.

Create a small group of people (you!) who might help one another going forward.

Show you how to help yourselves.

Show you what's possible - breadth not depth. There are lots of moving
parts to understand - let's not get hung up on too many of them.  The idea
is to get you programming and then give a broad sweep of what's possible.

Solve problems just over the horizon of what you can do without programming.

Learn by solving real problems, not in a dry, theoretical way.

This is a course for beginners. If you're not a beginner, you're expected
to help others.

Broad range of students in the class. Help each other. Be generous.  Close
the gaps. Make yourselves into a little community. Self support, teach,
etc.

In an academic context, generating figures seems to be the gateway drug to
becoming a programmer.

## Difficult tradeoffs

On the one hand I want you to be able to do everything. On the other, it can
take an entire day to get everyone set up locally. So we will use an online
Python environment.

This is just one example of trading better understanding for better ease-of-use.

There are many more. I am not showing you the shell. There are many, many
packages. There are many graphics packages. You could have AI write all the
course code (bit we won't).

## Programming is actually pretty simple

It's almost all just common sense. Think about how you would do something in the
real world, then do that in the computer.

Things that make programming seem hard are: weird names, weird details,
frozen accidents.

Programming is often dressed up to look harder than it is. People with
knowledge making themselves seem important and protecting their positions.

It might look like there are big differences between you and others in
the class, but that's not the case at all. Not in what you already know
and not in your aptitude, since what's mainly needed is clear thinking and
common sense.

If you don't understand something, probably half the people in the room
don't either. Please speak up!

There are _very few_ control flow things (if/then/else, looping).

There are _very few_ data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries).

These things are just fancy names for things you have been doing every day
for your entire life.

Almost all programs start out and then grow in the same way. From something
very simple.  From an itch. They always look complex when you arrive late,
after many incremental rounds of development.

Many things are packaged up, easy to install, well documented, and show
example usage.

All programming languages are (more or less) the same.

## Thinking clearly about how we do things

What steps do you take to e.g., get here to this class? Make a cake? Figure out
the most common words in a book (or names in Berlin)?

If you can make a cake, you can certainly learn to program.

## Extremely basic Python comments

* Whitespace is important!
* There are "data structures" (just like in real life).
* There is "flow of control" (just like in real life).
* There are "variables" (just like in Excel or when writing things down).
* You can `import` things (like taking a cookbook of recipes off the shelf).
* Indexing of lists starts at zero.

### Things to say:

```
    For every thing on your list of things you plan to say:
        Say the thing.
```
